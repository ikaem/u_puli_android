1. need to use flow on event screen
- because if from event screen navigate to bookmarks, remove bookmark, then back to event screen, it will not update the bookmark status
2. splash screen with icons of all events sources
3. on event, we will see a source icon too to know where we are navigating too - this will be tied to a source provided by the event model
